# Lichess-Bundle

A repository containing simple bash scripts to start and monitor all the
different pieces for running lichess locally.

## Variables

If lila, fishnet, and lila-ws are not submodules here, you should symnlink the
`start.sh` script to the parent directory containing all three and run it there,
or change the variable `li_dir` to the parent directory if you wish to run from
this location.
